<h4 class="POOH">POOH</h4><p class="speech"> It is consequently my degrading duty to serve this
upstart as First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Chief Justice,
Commander-in-Chief, Lord High Admiral, Master of the Buckhounds,
Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor,
both acting and elect, all rolled into one.  And at a salary!  A
Pooh-Bah paid for his services!  I a salaried minion!  But I do
it!  It revolts me, but I do it!
</p>

<h4 class="NANK">NANK.</h4><p class="speech">And it does you credit.</p> 

<h4 class="POOH">POOH</h4><p class="speech">But I don't stop at that.  I go and dine with
middle-class people on reasonable terms.  I dance at cheap
suburban parties for a moderate fee.  I accept refreshment at any
hands, however lowly.  I also retail State secrets at a very low
figure.  For instance, any further information about Yum-Yum
would come under the head of a State secret.  (Nanki-Poo takes his
hint, and gives him money.)  (Aside.)  Another insult and, I
think, a light one!

           SONG—POOH-BAH with NANKI-POO and PISH-TUSH.

                 Young man, despair,
                      Likewise go to,
                 Yum-Yum the fair
                      You must not woo.
                      It will not do:
                      I'm sorry for you,
                 You very imperfect ablutioner!
                      This very day
                           From school Yum-Yum
                      Will wend her way,
                           And homeward come,
                           With beat of drum
                           And a rum-tum-tum,
                 To wed the Lord High executioner!
                      And the brass will crash,
                           And the trumpets bray,
                      And they'll cut a dash
                           On their wedding day.
                 She'll toddle away, as all aver,
                 With the Lord High Executioner '

             And the brass will crash, etc.
                 It's a hopeless case,
                      As you may see,
                 And in your place
                      Away I'd flee;
                      But don't blame me—
                      I'm sorry to be
                 Of your pleasure a diminutioner.
                      They'll vow their pact
                           Extremely soon,
                      In point of fact
                           This afternoon.
                           Her honeymoon
                           With that buffoon
                 At seven commences, so you shun her!

 <h4 class="NANK">NANK.</h4>
<p class="speech">   
And I have journeyed for a month, or nearly,
To learn that Yum-Yum, whom I love so dearly,
This day to Ko-Ko is to be united!

  <h4 class="POOH">POOH.</h4>
  <p class="speech">The fact appears to be as you've recited:
But here he comes, equipped as suits his station;
He'll give you any further information.

        <p class="group">             Enter Chorus of Nobles.

        Behold the Lord High Executioner
     A personage of noble rank and title—
         A dignified and potent officer,
    Whose functions are particularly vital!
                      Defer, defer,
             To the Lord High Executioner!
