<h4 class="PISH-TISH">PISH.</h4>  <p class="speech">And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?</p>

<h4 class="NANKI-POO">NANK.</h4>  <p class="speech">
I'll tell you.  A year ago I was a member of the
Titipu town band.  It was my duty to take the cap round for
contributions.  While discharging this delicate office, I saw
Yum-Yum.  We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to
her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was
hopeless.  Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town.  Judge
of my delight when I heard, a month ago, that Ko-Ko had been con-
demned to death for flirting!  I hurried back at once, in the
hope of finding Yum-Yum at liberty to listen to my protestations.
                </p>
<h4 class="PISH-TISH">PISH.</h4><p class="speech">
It is true that Ko-Ko was condemned to death for
 flirting, but he was reprieved at the last moment, and raised to
the exalted rank of Lord High Executioner under the following
remarkable circumstances:</p>

          <h4 class="group">SONG—PISH-TUSH and CHORUS.</h4> 
<p class="song">
               Our great Mikado, virtuous man,
               When he to rule our land began,
                     Resolved to try
                     A plan whereby
               Young men might best be steadied.

               So he decreed, in words succinct,
            That all who flirted, leered or winked
                (Unless connubially linked),
                Should forthwith be beheaded.

               And I expect you'll all agree
               That he was right to so decree.
                And I am right,
                And you are right,
              And all is right as right can be!
</p>
  
<h4 class="group">CHORUS.</h4> 
<p class="song">
                    And you are right.
                    And we are right, etc

             This stem decree, you'll understand,
           Caused great dismay throughout the land!
                    For young and old
                    And shy and bold
                Were equally affected.
              The youth who winked a roving eye,
              Or breathed a non-connubial sigh,
               Was thereupon condemned to die—
                   He usually objected.

               And you'll allow, as I expect,
               That he was right to so object.
                     And I am right,
                    And you are right,
               And everything is quite correct!
</p>
<h4 class="group">CHORUS.</h4>  
<p class="song">
                       And you are right,
                      And we are right, etc.

                  And so we straight let out on bail
                    A convict from the county jail,
                      Whose head was next
                       On some pretext
                   Condemned to be mown off,
                And made him Headsman, for we said,
                   "Who's next to be decapited
                Cannot cut off another's head
                  Until he's cut his own off."

               And we are right, I think you'll say,
                   To argue in this kind of way;
                       And I am right,
                       And you are right,
                And all is right—too-looral-lay!

Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor, Lord High Executioner of
Titipu! Why, that's the highest rank a citizen can attain!
         </p>

<h4 class="POOH-BAH">POOH.</h4><p class="speech">
It is.  Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
die, and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence,
has rolled the two offices into one, and every judge is now his
own executioner.</p>

<h4 class="NANKI-POO">NANK.</h4> <p class="speech">
But how good of you (for I see that you are a
nobleman of the highest rank) to condescend to tell all this time, a mere strolling minstrel!</p>

<h4 class="POOH-BAH">POOH.</h4> <p class="speech"> 
Don't mention it.  I am, in point of fact, a
particularly haughty and exclusive person, of pre-Adamite
ancestral descent.  You will understand this when I tell you that
I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic
globule.  Consequently, my family pride is something</p>

<h4 class="inconceivable">inconceivable.</h4> <p class="speech"> 
I can't help it.  I was born sneering.  But I
struggle hard to overcome this defect.  I mortify my pride
continually.  When all the great officers of State resigned in a
body because they were too proud to serve under an ex-tailor, did
 I not unhesitatingly accept all their posts at once?</p>

<h4 class="PISH-TISH">PISH.</h4><p class="speech">
 And the salaries attached to them?  You did.</p>

                  and left, finishing on steps at the back of stage.)
