                Enter Pish-Tush.
PISH.  And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?
NANK.  I'll tell you.  A year ago I was a member of the
  Titipu town band.  It was my duty to take the cap round for
  contributions.  While discharging this delicate office, I saw
  Yum-Yum.  We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to
  her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was
  hopeless.  Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town.  Judge
  of my delight when I heard, a month ago, that Ko-Ko had been con-
  demned to death for flirting!  I hurried back at once, in the
  hope of finding Yum-Yum at liberty to listen to my protestations.
PISH.  It is true that Ko-Ko was condemned to death for
  flirting, but he was reprieved at the last moment, and raised to
  the exalted rank of Lord High Executioner under the following
  remarkable circumstances:

            SONG—PISH-TUSH and CHORUS.

       Our great Mikado, virtuous man,
       When he to rule our land began,
                 Resolved to try
                 A plan whereby
            Young men might best be steadied.

       So he decreed, in words succinct,
       That all who flirted, leered or winked
       (Unless connubially linked),
            Should forthwith be beheaded.

                 And I expect you'll all agree
                 That he was right to so decree.
                      And I am right,
                      And you are right,
                 And all is right as right can be!

CHORUS.             And you are right.
                      And we are right, etc

       This stem decree, you'll understand,
       Caused great dismay throughout the land!
                 For young and old
                 And shy and bold
            Were equally affected.
       The youth who winked a roving eye,
       Or breathed a non-connubial sigh,
       Was thereupon condemned to die—
            He usually objected.

                 And you'll allow, as I expect,
                 That he was right to so object.
                      And I am right,
                      And you are right,
                 And everything is quite correct!
CHORUS.        And you are right,
                 And we are right, etc.

       And so we straight let out on bail
       A convict from the county jail,
                 Whose head was next
                 On some pretext
            Condemned to be mown off,
       And made him Headsman, for we said,
       "Who's next to be decapited
       Cannot cut off another's head
            Until he's cut his own off."

            And we are right, I think you'll say,
            To argue in this kind of way;
                 And I am right,
                 And you are right,
            And all is right—too-looral-lay!

CHORUS.        And you are right,
                 And we are right, etc.

                                                              [Exeunt
  

(Katisha rushes furiously up stage, clearing the crowd away right
and left, finishing on steps at the back of stage.)
