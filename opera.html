                Enter Pish-Tush.

       PISH.  And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?
       NANK.  I'll tell you.  A year ago I was a member of the
  Titipu town band.  It was my duty to take the cap round for
  contributions.  While discharging this delicate office, I saw
  Yum-Yum.  We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to
  her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was
  hopeless.  Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town.  Judge
  of my delight when I heard, a month ago, that Ko-Ko had been con-
  demned to death for flirting!  I hurried back at once, in the
  hope of finding Yum-Yum at liberty to listen to my protestations.
       PISH.  It is true that Ko-Ko was condemned to death for
  flirting, but he was reprieved at the last moment, and raised to
  the exalted rank of Lord High Executioner under the following
  remarkable circumstances:

                      SONG—PISH-TUSH and CHORUS.

       Our great Mikado, virtuous man,
       When he to rule our land began,
                 Resolved to try
                 A plan whereby
            Young men might best be steadied.

       So he decreed, in words succinct,
       That all who flirted, leered or winked
       (Unless connubially linked),
            Should forthwith be beheaded.

                 And I expect you'll all agree
                 That he was right to so decree.
                      And I am right,
                      And you are right,
                 And all is right as right can be!

  CHORUS.             And you are right.
                      And we are right, etc

       This stem decree, you'll understand,
       Caused great dismay throughout the land!
                 For young and old
                 And shy and bold
            Were equally affected.
       The youth who winked a roving eye,
       Or breathed a non-connubial sigh,
       Was thereupon condemned to die—
            He usually objected.

                 And you'll allow, as I expect,
                 That he was right to so object.
                      And I am right,
                      And you are right,
                 And everything is quite correct!

  CHORUS.        And you are right,
                 And we are right, etc.

       And so we straight let out on bail
       A convict from the county jail,
                 Whose head was next
                 On some pretext
            Condemned to be mown off,
       And made him Headsman, for we said,
       "Who's next to be decapited
       Cannot cut off another's head
            Until he's cut his own off."

            And we are right, I think you'll say,
            To argue in this kind of way;
                 And I am right,
                 And you are right,
            And all is right—too-looral-lay!

  CHORUS.        And you are right,
                 And we are right, etc.

                                                              [Exeunt
  Chorus.

                               Enter Pooh-Bah.

       NANK.  Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor, Lord High Executioner of
  Titipu! Why, that's the highest rank a citizen can attain!
       POOH.  It is.  Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
  difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
  die, and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence,
  has rolled the two offices into one, and every judge is now his
  own executioner.
       NANK.  But how good of you (for I see that you are a
  nobleman of the highest rank) to condescend to tell all this to
  me, a mere strolling minstrel!
       POOH.  Don't mention it.  I am, in point of fact, a
  particularly haughty and exclusive person, of pre-Adamite
  ancestral descent.  You will understand this when I tell you that
  I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic
  globule.  Consequently, my family pride is something
  inconceivable.  I can't help it.  I was born sneering.  But I
  struggle hard to overcome this defect.  I mortify my pride
  continually.  When all the great officers of State resigned in a
  body because they were too proud to serve under an ex-tailor, did
  I not unhesitatingly accept all their posts at once?
       PISH.  And the salaries attached to them?  You did.
       POOH.  It is consequently my degrading duty to serve this
  upstart as First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Chief Justice,
  Commander-in-Chief, Lord High Admiral, Master of the Buckhounds,
  Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor,
  both acting and elect, all rolled into one.  And at a salary!  A
  Pooh-Bah paid for his services!  I a salaried minion!  But I do
  it!  It revolts me, but I do it!
       NANK.  And it does you credit.
       POOH.  But I don't stop at that.  I go and dine with
  middle-class people on reasonable terms.  I dance at cheap
  suburban parties for a moderate fee.  I accept refreshment at any
  hands, however lowly.  I also retail State secrets at a very low
  figure.  For instance, any further information about Yum-Yum
  would come under the head of a State secret.  (Nanki-Poo takes his
  hint, and gives him money.)  (Aside.)  Another insult and, I
  think, a light one!

           SONG—POOH-BAH with NANKI-POO and PISH-TUSH.

                 Young man, despair,
                      Likewise go to,
                 Yum-Yum the fair
                      You must not woo.
                      It will not do:
                      I'm sorry for you,
                 You very imperfect ablutioner!
                      This very day
                           From school Yum-Yum
                      Will wend her way,
                           And homeward come,
                           With beat of drum
                           And a rum-tum-tum,
                 To wed the Lord High executioner!
                      And the brass will crash,
                           And the trumpets bray,
                      And they'll cut a dash
                           On their wedding day.
                 She'll toddle away, as all aver,
                 With the Lord High Executioner '

  NANK. and POOH.  And the brass will crash, etc.

                 It's a hopeless case,
                      As you may see,
                 And in your place
                      Away I'd flee;
                      But don't blame me—
                      I'm sorry to be
                 Of your pleasure a diminutioner.
                      They'll vow their pact
                           Extremely soon,
                      In point of fact
                           This afternoon.
                           Her honeymoon
                           With that buffoon
                 At seven commences, so you shun her!

  ALL.                And the brass will crash, etc.
                                                             [Exit
  Pish-Tush.

                       RECIT.—NANKI-POO and POOH-BAH.

  NANK.     And I have journeyed for a month, or nearly,
            To learn that Yum-Yum, whom I love so dearly,
            This day to Ko-Ko is to be united!
  POOH.     The fact appears to be as you've recited:
            But here he comes, equipped as suits his station;
            He'll give you any further information.
                                              [Exeunt Pooh-Bah and
  Nanki-Poo.

                           Enter Chorus of Nobles.

            Behold the Lord High Executioner
                 A personage of noble rank and title—
            A dignified and potent officer,
                 Whose functions are particularly vital!
                      Defer, defer,
                 To the Lord High Executioner!

                        Enter Ko-Ko attended.

                             SOLO—KO-KO.

       Taken from the county jail
            By a set of curious chances;
       Liberated then on bail,
            On my own recognizances;
       Wafted by a favouring gale
            As one sometimes is in trances,
       To a height that few can scale,
            Save by long and weary dances;
       Surely, never had a male
            Under such like circumstances
       So adventurous a tale,
            Which may rank with most romances.

  CHORUS.             Defer, defer,
            To the Lord High Executioner, etc.

       KO.  Gentlemen, I'm much touched by this reception.  I can
  only trust that by strict attention to duty I shall ensure a
  continuance of those favours which it will ever be my study to
  deserve.  If I should ever be called upon to act professionally,
  I am happy to think that there will be no difficulty in finding
  plenty of people whose loss will be a distinct gain to society at
  large.

               SONG—KO-KO with CHORUS OF MEN.

  As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,
       I've got a little list—I've got a little list
  Of society offenders who might well be underground,
       And who never would be missed—who never would be missed!
  There's the pestilential nuisances who write for autographs—
  All people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs—
  All children who are up in dates, and floor you with 'em flat—
  All persons who in shaking hands, shake hands with you like
       that—
  And all third persons who on spoiling tte—ttes insist—
       They'd none of 'em be missed—they'd none of 'em be missed!

  CHORUS.   He's got 'em on the list—he's got 'em on the list;
                 And they'll none of 'em be missed—they'll none of
                      'em be missed.
  There's the banjo serenader, and the others of his race,
       And the piano-organist—I've got him on the list!
  And the people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face,
       They never would be missed—they never would be missed!
  Then the idiot who praises, with enthusiastic tone,
  All centuries but this, and every country but his own;
  And the lady from the provinces, who dresses like a guy,
  And who "doesn't think she waltzes, but would rather like to
       try";
  And that singular anomaly, the lady novelist—
       I don't think she'd be missed—I'm sure she'd not he missed!

  CHORUS.   He's got her on the list—he's got her on the list;
                 And I don't think she'll be missed—I'm sure
                      she'll not be missed!

  And that Nisi Prius nuisance, who just now is rather rife,
       The Judicial humorist—I've got him on the list!
  All funny fellows, comic men, and clowns of private life—
       They'd none of 'em be missed—they'd none of 'em be missed.
  And apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind,
  Such as—What d'ye call him—Thing'em-bob, and
       likewise—Never-mind,
  And 'St—'st—'st—and What's-his-name, and also You-know-who—
  The task of filling up the blanks I'd rather leave to you.
  But it really doesn't matter whom you put upon the list,
       For they'd none of 'em be missed—they'd none of 'em be
            missed!

  CHORUS.   You may put 'em on the list—you may put 'em on the
                 list;
                 And they'll none of 'em be missed—they'll none of
                      'em be missed!
                      (Katisha rushes furiously up stage, clearing the crowd away right
       and left, finishing on steps at the back of stage.)
       ENSEMBLE.
       KATISHA.                        THE OTHERS.

Ye torrents roar!                       We'll hear no more,
 Ye tempests howl!                       Ill-omened owl.
Your wrath outpour                      To joy we soar,
 With angry growl!                       Despite your
scowl!
Do ye your worst, my vengeance           The echoes of our festival
call
Shall rise triumphant over all!          Shall rise triumphant over
all!
Prepare for woe,                         Away you go,
 Ye haughty lords,                        Collect your
hordes;
At once I go                             Proclaim your woe
 Mikado-wards,                             In dismal
chords
My wrongs with vengeance shall           We do not heed their
dismal
be crowned!                              sound
My wrongs with vengeance shall           For joy reigns everywhere
be crowned!                              around.
